establishing various means of involvement activities and solving their problems in a 
simplest way. In this website user can list their complaint in complaint column after submitting 
it will be given to the respected ward to handle the complaint. Establishing a definition of 
cryptocurrencies is no easy task. Performing all these tasks manually becomes too complex 
and time consuming. The aim of this document is to give user the facility to do the work by

admin. By using this system, he/she can explore the website. They’ll be able to Know the new 
schemes of the government through the website by just sitting at any place by their fingertip.
