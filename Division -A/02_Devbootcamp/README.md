## Introduction
After this covid period E-Learning has become an important part of our education system, So
we introduce DevBootCamp which is an online course provider for Aspiring Software
developers.
DevBootCamp offers online courses, certifications, and degrees in various Tech Fields.
The Problem we identify is, Users need a website to track their work and create a routine that
can maximize their workout.
The Solution we proposed is,The user will be able to track work for a particular day with the
ability to add exercises. Each exercise can have a corresponding detail of sets and
information about how to do the corresponding exercise.
