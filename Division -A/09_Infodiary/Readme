Description:-
In today’s fast-paced business world, it is very hard to remember everyone’s name and their 
individual preferences. That’s why it’s essential to store data electronically, share it with others 
when needed. Here, we are creating a web-based application in which we are providing 
information about various services to the customers. So, we have come up with a concept of 
INFODIARY. The main problem arises when there is a need to search for some contact services 
but you are not able to fetch the information. Solution is only one that to make an application that 
can fulfil all these needs.
