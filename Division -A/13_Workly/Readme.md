       An Employee Management System is a distributed application that will be developed to maintain the details of employees working in any organization. 
       It would maintain the information about the personal details of employees, so that the human resource of the organization can easily know the details of all its employees. 
       It would be simple to understand and can be used by anyone who is not even familiar with legacy employees system. It would be user friendly and just ask the user to follow step by step operations by giving him few options. It would be fast and can perform many operations of a company. 
       This software package would be developed using the powerful coding tools of Visual Basic at the frontend with a Microsoft Access database at backend. For further enhancement or development of the package, the userâ€™s feedback will be considered. The Employees Management Software would make it easy for the employer to keep track of all records. 
       The combination of these modules into one application assures the perfect platform for re-engineering and aligning Human Resource processes along with the organizational goals.
       This proposed system would bring about an easy way of maintaining the details of employees working within any organization.
       The goal of this project is to design and develop an employee management system to fill existing gaps in the electronic management of employees.
