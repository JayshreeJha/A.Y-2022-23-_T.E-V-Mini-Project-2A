InTroduction:

Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the 
atmosphere for a given location. Weather apps are your ideal companion when it comes to 
having an estimate of the weather and thereby lets you make informed decisions. Human 
beings have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since the 
19th century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current 
state of the atmosphere at a given place and using meteorology to project how the atmosphere 
will change.
This Weather Monitor App provides the user with real time weather information. This system 
is dynamic and updated on an hourly basis thus allowing to keep up with the ever-changing 
weather. Weather data is not only necessary for researchers or scientists, ordinary people can 
be benefited from it as well. People nowadays are feeling the necessity of weather data as 
well. There are a variety of weather mobile apps in Google Play and the App store, those apps 
have great features and functionalities to satisfy users. However, only a few of them have 
friendly user interface and human centered interactions, which means that a lot of them might 
be difficult to be navigated even though they provide enough functionalities. It is not 
convenient for new users. 
Therefore, we would like to do improvements on weather apps. As well as temperature 
forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days. On an everyday 
basis, people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day. Since outdoor 
activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and wind chill, forecasts can be used to 
plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them.
